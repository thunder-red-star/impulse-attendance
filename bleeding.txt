This is the bleeding edge
The place to be when you're tired of the rest
Over here code isn't checked
But rather it's a place where your computer gets wrecked

In that place called the bleeding edge
Code roams around free and open in the javascript dredge
The code doesn't always work the best
But you can rest assured that it's gonna go west

Right here, right now, right there
The bleeding edge
The place to be when you're tired of the rest
Over here code isn't checked
Put your computer to the test

Let's see what happens when you
Run the code from the bleeding edge
Maybe it'll work, maybe it'll break
And when you're done it'll be like
Throwing your computer into a lake

Every time you run the code from the bleeding edge
It's gonna be different
And you'll be different
But I'm not gonna lie
The bleeding edge is where you're gonna be
When you're tired of the rest

My name is John Doe
I'm a software engineer
I know how to code
Especially in the bleeding edge

MySQL, SQLite, Sequelize, and MongoDB
All the things that make the bleeding edge
Possibly the most popular database
To be used in the bleeding edge

And to those non-developers
The bleeding edge doesn't bleed
It's the bleeding edge, the bleeding edge
Where you're gonna be when you're tired of the rest

You're gonna be like
Throwing your computer into a lake
Hanging your computer from the ceiling
And when you're done it'll be like
Aaahh, I'm gonna be dead
From the bleeding edge

Yeeeaaah!!!!!!!!!!!!
